# ✅ Build Success - Large Sourcemaps Generated!

The project has been successfully configured and built to generate very large sourcemaps for benchmarking.

## 📊 Build Results

### Largest Sourcemap Files

Located in `.next/server/`:

1. **chunks/7132.js.map**: `34MB` 🔥
2. **chunks/82.js.map**: `8.2MB`
3. **middleware.js.map**: `7.3MB`
4. **instrumentation.js.map**: `6.8MB`
5. **chunks/9230.js.map**: `6.7MB`
6. **chunks/7902.js.map**: `1.7MB`
7. Plus ~50 additional sourcemap files

### Total Build Output

- **Total `.next/` directory**: **3.3GB**
- **Client-side bundles** (`.next/static/chunks/`):
  - `benchmark.js`: **8.3MB** (minified)
  - `vendors.js`: **2.8MB** (minified)
- **Server-side sourcemaps**: **60+ MB** in aggregate
- **Source code**: 17MB (620,000 lines)
- **node_modules**: 1.8GB (672 packages)

## 🎯 What Was Done

### Dependencies Added
- **52 large npm packages** including:
  - 3D/Graphics: three, babylonjs, d3, plotly.js, echarts, vis-network
  - UI Libraries: @mui/material, antd, semantic-ui-react, @chakra-ui/react, @blueprintjs/core
  - Utilities: lodash, ramda, rxjs, moment, mathjs, immutable
  - Editors: monaco-editor, draft-js, quill, tinymce
  - And many more...

### Generated Code
- **150 benchmark files** in `components/benchmark/generated/`
- **~3,000 lines per file**
- **Total: ~620,000 lines of TypeScript/React code**
- Each file contains:
  - 50 TypeScript interfaces
  - 35 utility functions using various libraries
  - 18 React components
  - 8 state machines
  - 15 data transformers

### Configuration Changes
- Enabled `productionBrowserSourceMaps: true`
- Increased Node.js heap size to 8GB (`NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'`)
- Custom webpack configuration for larger bundles
- Reduced code splitting to create bigger chunks

## 🚀 How to Build

To rebuild and regenerate the sourcemaps:

```bash
# Clean previous build
rm -rf .next

# Build with sourcemaps (Sentry uploads disabled)
SENTRY_DISABLE_SOURCEMAP_UPLOAD=true pnpm build
```

The build takes approximately 1-2 minutes and requires at least 8GB of available RAM.

## 📦 Files Generated

The build generates files in:
- `.next/server/` - Server-side bundles and sourcemaps (largest files)
- `.next/static/chunks/` - Client-side JavaScript bundles
- `.next/static/css/` - CSS files

All sourcemap files have the `.map` extension.

## 🔧 Adjusting the Size

If you need even larger or smaller sourcemaps:

### To Increase Size
1. Edit `scripts/generate-benchmark-code.ts`
2. Increase `NUM_FILES` (currently 150)
3. Increase `LINES_PER_FILE` (currently ~3000)
4. Run: `pnpm run generate:benchmark`
5. Rebuild: `pnpm build`

### To Decrease Size
1. Reduce `NUM_FILES` in the generator script
2. Or delete some batch files in `components/benchmark/`
3. Rebuild

## ⚠️ Notes

- The benchmark code is only loaded in production builds via the `BenchmarkLoader` component
- It doesn't affect development mode (`pnpm dev`)
- The generated code is valid TypeScript/React but designed for bundle size, not runtime performance
- Most sourcemaps are generated on the server side due to Next.js SSR

## 🧪 Testing Your Tool

The sourcemap files are now available in the `.next/` directory for your benchmarking tool to process!

Key files to test:
- `.next/server/chunks/7132.js.map` (34MB - largest)
- `.next/server/chunks/82.js.map` (8.2MB)
- Or process all files in `.next/server/**/*.map`

Enjoy benchmarking! 🎉
